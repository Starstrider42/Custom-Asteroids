Custom Asteroids Test Sequence
============

1. Copy the desired asteroids.cfg file (or lack thereof) to GameData/CustomAsteroids.
2. Start a game of KSP.
3. Start a new sandbox game (overwriting if necessary).
4. Immediately go into the Tracking Station and filter for only unknown objects
5. While there are less than ~30 known asteroids
    a. Track all unknown asteroids on the map.
    b. Accelerate time to 10000×
    c. Return to 1× when new asteroids appear.
6. Check orbital distribution in game
7. Exit the Tracking Station (to ensure the game is saved), then quit
8. Search KSP_Data/output_log.txt for errors. All errors generated by the package should be prefixed by "[CustomAsteroids]:"
